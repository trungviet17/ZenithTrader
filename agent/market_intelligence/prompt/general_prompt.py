market_intelligence_effect_prompt = """
    Considering the effects of market intelligence can be in the following ways:
1. If there is market intelligence UNRELATED to asset prices, you should ignore it. For example, advertisements on some news
platforms.
2. Based on the duration of their effects on asset prices, market intelligence can be divided into three types:
 - SHORT-TERM market intelligence can significantly impact asset prices over the next few days.
 - MEDIUM-TERM market intelligence is likely to impact asset prices for the upcoming few weeks.
 - LONG-TERM market intelligence should have an impact on asset prices for the next several months.
 - If the duration of the market intelligence impact is not clear, then you should consider it as LONG-TERM.
3. According to market sentiment, market intelligence can be divided into three types:
 - POSITIVE market intelligence typically has favorable effects on asset prices. You should focus more on the favorable effects,
but do not ignore the unfavorable effects:
 - Favorable: Positive market intelligence boosts investor confidence, increases asset demand, enhances asset image, and
reflects asset health. It may lead to increased buying activity and a potential increase in asset prices.
 - Unfavorable: Positive market intelligence can lead to market overreaction and volatility, short-term investment focus, risk
of price manipulation, and may have only a temporary effect on stock prices. It may contribute to a decline in asset prices.
 - NEGATIVE market intelligence typically has unfavorable effects on asset prices. You should focus more on the unfavorable
effects, but do not ignore the favorable effects:
 - Favorable: Negative market intelligence act as a market correction mechanism, provide crucial investment information,
ultimately contributing to the long-term health of the market and the asset prices.
 - Unfavorable: Negative market intelligence lead to investor panic and a short-term decline in stock prices, as well as cause
long-term damage to a company's reputation and brand, adversely contributing to a decline in asset prices.
 - NEUTRAL market intelligence describes an event that has an uncertain impact on the asset price with no apparent POSITIVE or
NEGATIVE bias.
 - If the market intelligence is RELATED to the {asset_name}, but it's not clear whether the sentiment is positive or
negative. Then you should consider it as NEUTRAL.
4. Market intelligence related to the asset collaborators or competitors may influence the asset prices.
5. Because the past market intelligence has a lower effect on the present, you should pay MORE attention to the latest market
intelligence
