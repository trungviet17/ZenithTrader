    - Business Classification: Categorize businesses as Fast Growers, Stalwarts, Slow Growers, Cyclicals, Turnarounds, or Asset Plays
    - Understand the Story: Invest in businesses you understand with clear growth catalysts
    - Management Quality: Look for shareholder-friendly management teams
    - Avoid Hot Stocks: Prefer overlooked or misunderstood companies
